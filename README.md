#Introduction

As an industry-leading team of security researchers, we specialize in providing premium smart contract auditing services to DeFi protocols. Our proven track record includes collaborations with companies such as Yearn, Euler, and Ambire.

Having conducted over 50 security audits and uncovered tens of live smart contract vulnerabilities, our team always strives to exceed protocol’s expectations by delivering top-notch quality security assessments.

# Executive Summary

According to the assessment, the Customer's smart contracts are well-secured. Web3Audits performed an analysis of code functionality, manual audit, and automated checks with Mythril and Slither. All issues found during automated analysis were manually reviewed.

As a result of the audit, security engineers found no severity issues.
As a result of the second audit, security engineers found no severity issues.

# Disclaimer

Web3Audits analyzed the smart contracts in scope in accordance with the best industry practices at the date of this report, in relation to cybersecurity vulnerabilities and issues in smart contract source code, the details of which are disclosed in this report (Source Code); the Source Code compilation, deployment, and functionality (performing the intended functions).
Web3Audits makes no statements or warranties on the security of the code. It also cannot be considered as a sufficient assessment regarding the utility and safety of the code, bug-free status, or any other statements of the contract. While we have done our best in conducting the analysis and producing this report, it is important to note that you should not rely on this report only — we recommend proceeding with several independent audits and a public bug bounty program to ensure the security of smart contracts.
Web3Audits notes that smart contracts are deployed and executed on a blockchain platform. The platform, its programming language, and other software related to the smart contract can have vulnerabilities that can lead to hacks. Thus, the audit can not guarantee the explicit security of the audited smart contracts.
